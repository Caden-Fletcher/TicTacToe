A simple game of Tic Tac Toe designed as a winform application.

The first game will have X starting first then it alternates after every new game.

# To Do
There are plans to implement a simple AI to play against.

To achieve this the program will be redesigned; Player 1 will be the human player and Player 2 will be the computer player.

The AI will start off simple, prioritizing: Center, Corners, Sides

The AI will choose a random tile if there is more than one tile to choose.


Player pieces will be randomly generated. Two fields will be created to show what player piece belongs to what player.
